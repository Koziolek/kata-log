# Kata-log

This repository contains set of kata exercises prepared in Java, Scala and other JVM based languages. You could 
easily adapt it to other object oriented languages. Most of kata contains only description (on master branch). Some 
contains few code that is start point of exercise. 

## Repository rules

* If You want to do some kata then do not clone this repository directly but fork it.
* Only pull request with fixes of exercises and new ones  will be accepted.
* Do not send your solutions.  

## How to kata

You could do kata alone or in group of people. If you work as group pick one of you as sensei. This person is 
responsible for your work as a team. 
Before you start prepare your IDE and work environment. Be sure that all elements works fine, you have all 
dependencies in local repository, all plugins installed etc.
Then open description of selected kata and start of work. 
After all discus about exercise and try to find element that was most difficult for you.

### Sensei responsibilities 

Person who is a sensei in kata session should:

 * read loudly each point of kata
 * then start to implement it
 * take care of work of all members
 * adjust tempo of work to team
 * take care of selected focus
 * control pomodoro timer (if in use)

Sensei screen should be shared somehow (desktop sharing, use projector) to all members. 

## Focus

All kata has list of things that you should focus. Select only one thing and try to focus only on that. Next time 
when you  do kata you should select other point from that list. After few more plays you could try to combine things 
from list to build more complicated tasks.  

Most popular focus are

 * work better in IDE. In this case you focus at using key shortcuts, plugins and IDE features. 
 * work in TDD. In this case you focus at proper flow of coding. Write test first, make each step as small as 
 possible. Run tests as often as you can. 
 * Know your library. This case is dedicated to learn new features of frameworks. You try to use selected features.
 * XP practise. Like pair programming. 

## Tips, tricks and good practises
 
 * Each time you start kata create new branch named from selected kata. On that branch mark selected 
 focus in description file. You should be able to answer which kata and what was selected focus based on branch name. 
 * After kata write your conclusions in file saved on branch. 
 * If you work in group try to pick sensei randomly. Sometimes good decision is that most expired developer is sensei
  but in most cases random selection makes much more fun (and knowledge)  
 * Remember that kata is exercise that help you to learn and practise some elements of developer workshop. 
 * Use pomodoro technique. Some kata could be quite long. Split they to 25 minutes parts. 
 * You could pick different sensei for each part (will be more fun).
 * Remove all elements that could disturb you.
